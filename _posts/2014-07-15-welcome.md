This is is just a another test blog, please ignore the actual content.

What is important is the code that is shown below if you want to read it.

<!--more-->

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <my-very-nice-delite-element></my-very-nice-delite-element>
  </body>
</html>
```

Isn't it good? I can also do lists:

* 1st item
* 2nd item
* 3rd item
